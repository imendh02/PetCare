        <h1>“What is Pet Boarding?”</h1>
        <p>We all hate leaving our pets behind when heading out of town, but one way to make
        sure they’re as comfortable as possible is to provide them care in a good environment.
        With Pet Care, we’ll have one of our highly-trained and background-checked sitters
        stay the night to take care of your pet’s food, water, bathroom, and exercise needs. 
        Your pet will be happy to stay in their comfortable, friendly home, and you can relax 
        knowing they are taken care of. </p>
